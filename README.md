# test-md


## The Concept

**test-md** is a manual testing framework, where test cases and test results are defined as a plain text files. **test-md** syntax essentially a [convention](syntax.md), which is built around [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).

## As fast as you can type

Markdown allows you to produce formatted text as fast as you can type. This allows you to create test case, test suite and test run without even clicking a mouse!
Markdown syntax is also a very easy to learn: 10 minutes is enough to learn it and start typing.

## Readability

Markdown is a human readable format. You do not need special software to read this files. This are just plain text files not overloaded with special tags and syntax. You can use your favorite text editor or viewer to read these files. Or you can easily convert them into more nicely formated documents, like: html, pdf, doc and other formats.

## Flexible format

Since test case is a plain text file, it does not have any restriction on style, format, links, images, [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com), language and encoding. If you follow the **test-md** convention, any **test-md** compatible runner should be able to understand your test case and execute it.

## Management

It's possible to organize test cases either into multiple folders and/or within same file. In order, to view or edit your test cases you can just scroll up and down inside file or use any file search tools.

## Flexible storage

As a file, you can decide to keep it within any version control system, like Git or Mercurial; any cloud storage, like Dropbox and Google Drive or just on your disk. It's your decision. You can easily share your test cases and test results with other users, using standard file sharing approaches.
